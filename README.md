### About Me

PhD in machine learning since 2016, after nearly 10 years of research regarding brain disease, I am now Senior Data Scientist with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, applying advanced analytics for various kinds of business lines. Financial crime is one of my focused area since late 2017, and I am leading a team of data scientist, data engineer and software developer to build new capability for the bank to detect suspicious transaction behaviour, employing graph/network method, as well as deep learning techniques on top of hadoop/spark and GPU.
